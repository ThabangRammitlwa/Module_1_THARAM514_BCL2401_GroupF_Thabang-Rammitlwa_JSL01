# [JSL01] Submission: Syntax-Engine Interaction Challenge

In this project i felt realy lost, thanx to scrimba and Freecode camp practice, i was able to do the work.
Firstly I do not understand what is regex thou i used it , i felt like i was coding what i do not know ,or rather what i don't fully understand,
then the is"trim" , i have no understanding on where to use it and when not to use it,hope to understand the usage of Syntax more better than what i do know.Working on SDF i thought i understand JS but the module showed me that the still a lot to learn and that i haven't really learned anything on JS.
